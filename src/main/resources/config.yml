# Login Messages v1.5.1
#
# There are two sections: ranks and players
# The ranks are permission based. Some example ranks are already created, but you can
# change these to your likings. Use %player% to display their name when they log in.
#
# Example:
# SuperAdmin:
#   permission: loginmessages.superadmin
#   message: "&b%player% is a &oSuper Admin"
#
# The player section is designed for a player to have their own login message.
# This is not permission based, but rather username based. Use %player% to display their name when they log in.
# Note that if a user has a player login message, they will not be able to use the ranks
# Example:
# Madgeek1450:
#   message: "&b%player% is a &6Master-ass-kicker&b."
